description: Configuration options for Django REST Framework Simple API Key
---

Some of Django REST Framework Simple API Key's behavior can be customized through settings variables in `settings.py`. You can find below the default `DRF_API_KEY` setting.

```python
# Django project settings.py
...

DRF_API_KEY = {
     "FERNET_SECRET": "",
     "API_KEY_LIFETIME": 365,
     "AUTHENTICATION_KEYWORD_HEADER": "Api-Key",
     "ROTATION_PERIOD": timedelta(days=7),
     "ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET": "",
     "IGNORED_ROUTES": ["/admin/"]  # Routes that should be ignored by API key authentication
}
```

Above, the default values for these settings are shown.

## `FERNET_SECRET`

The fernet key ([Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)) is used to encrypt and decrypt API Keys.

To generate a fresh fernet key, you can use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py generate_fernet_key
```

Make sure to store it somewhere safe and treat it as you will treat the `SECRET_KEY` Django setting.

## `API_KEY_LIFETIME`

Determines the validity period of a generated Api Key. The default value is 365 days.

## `AUTHENTICATION_KEYWORD_HEADER`

Determines the keyword that should come with every request made to your API. The default value is `Api-Key` and it is used in the following format:

```
Api-Key API_KEY
```

## `ROTATION_PERIOD`

The duration for which key rotation remains active. After this period, the rotation process completes and you'll need to manually swap the `FERNET_SECRET` and `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET` values.

**Default:** `timedelta(days=7)`

**Example:**

```python
from datetime import timedelta

DRF_API_KEY = {
    "ROTATION_PERIOD": timedelta(days=7),  # Rotation active for 7 days
}
```

## `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET`

The `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET` is a secondary Fernet key ([Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)) utilized within the `MultiFernet` cryptographic scheme. While the primary Fernet key (**fernet_key**) is used for the main encryption and decryption, the `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET` plays a pivotal role during key rotation phases.

In the context of `MultiFernet`:

- New tokens are encrypted using the `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET`.
- Tokens can be decrypted with either the `ROTATION_FERNET_SECRET` enabling a smooth key rotation without rendering existing tokens obsolete.

```bash
python manage.py generate_fernet_key
```

This strategic usage ensures that as you transition to a new key, older tokens encrypted with the previous key remain valid, and new tokens are encrypted using the new key. Thus, a seamless transition is achieved, enhancing security without causing disruptions.

## `IGNORED_ROUTES`

A list of URL paths that should be ignored by the API Key Analytics Middleware. Any request to a path that starts with any of these routes will not be tracked in the analytics. The default value is `["/admin/"]`. This setting is specifically used by the analytics middleware to determine which routes should be excluded from usage tracking.

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "IGNORED_ROUTES": [
        "/admin/",  # Excludes admin panel routes from analytics
        "/api/documents/",  # Excludes document API routes from analytics
        "/health/",  # Excludes health check endpoints from analytics
    ]
}
```

## `ENFORCE_HTTPS`

By default, we enforce HTTPS connections in production to prevent API keys from being transmitted over unencrypted HTTP. If someone tries to use an API key over HTTP, the request will be rejected.

**Default:** `None` (auto-detects: `True` when `DEBUG=False`, `False` when `DEBUG=True`)

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "ENFORCE_HTTPS": True,  # Reject HTTP requests in production
}
```

**Note:** ⚠️ Always set this to `True` in production! Sending API keys over HTTP is like sending passwords in plain text. See [Security](/docs/security) for more details.

## `ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING`

Controls whether security events are logged. When enabled, the package logs authentication attempts, API key creation/revocation, and security-related events.

**Default:** `True`

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING": True,  # Log security events
}
```

See [Security](/docs/security) for information about what events are logged and how to access them.

## `MAX_ENDPOINTS_PER_KEY`

Limits the number of unique endpoints that can be tracked per API key in analytics. This helps prevent abuse and keeps your database size manageable.

**Default:** `1000`

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "MAX_ENDPOINTS_PER_KEY": 1000,  # Limit tracked endpoints
}
```

## `MAX_ENDPOINT_LENGTH`

Limits the maximum length of endpoint paths stored in analytics. This prevents malicious or malformed endpoint paths from causing issues.

**Default:** `500`

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "MAX_ENDPOINT_LENGTH": 500,  # Maximum endpoint path length
}
```

## `IP_ADDRESS_HEADER`

Specifies which HTTP header to use for extracting the client IP address. This is useful when your application is behind a proxy or load balancer.

**Default:** `"REMOTE_ADDR"`

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "IP_ADDRESS_HEADER": "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",  # Use X-Forwarded-For header
}
```

**Note:** The authentication backend safely handles proxy headers to prevent IP spoofing. See [Security](/docs/security) for more details.

## `API_KEY_CLASS`

The fully qualified path to your custom API key model class, if you've created one. This is used by the analytics addon to reference the API key model.

**Default:** `"drf_simple_apikey.Apikey"`

**Example:**

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    "API_KEY_CLASS": "myapp.models.CustomAPIKey",  # Use custom model
}
```

**Note:** Only change this if you've created a custom API key model. See [Customizing API Key Model](/docs/customizing-api-key-model) for details.
