title: Package Renaming Migration Guide
description: How to migrate from djangorestframework-simple-apikey to drf-simple-apikey
---

As part of our efforts to streamline our package offerings, the `djangorestframework-simple-apikey` has been renamed to `drf-simple-apikey`. This section provides a detailed guide on how to migrate your project to use the new package name.

## Renaming the Package

1. **Uninstall the Old Package**: Remove the existing package by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip uninstall djangorestframework-simple-apikey
```

2. **Install the New Package**: Install the new package using pip:

```bash
pip install drf-simple-apikey
```

## Updating Project Imports

You will need to update your import statements in your Django project. Change all existing import statements from:

```python
import djangorestframework_simple_apikey
```

to:

```python
import drf_simple_apikey
```

## Migrating Django Settings

Update your Django project settings to reflect the changes in the package configuration:

- Change any references from `SIMPLE_API_KEY` settings to `DRF_API_KEY`. For example:

```python
# Old settings
SIMPLE_API_KEY = {
    'API_KEY': 'your-api-key-here',
    'OTHER_SETTINGS': 'values'
}

# New settings
DRF_API_KEY = {
    'API_KEY': 'your-api-key-here',
    'OTHER_SETTINGS': 'values'
}
```

Ensure that you update these settings throughout your project configuration files to avoid any issues during deployment or development.
