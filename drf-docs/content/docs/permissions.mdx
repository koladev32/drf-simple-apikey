description: Using permission classes for API key authorization
---

Permissions or authorization in Django are used to make sure the entity making the request has the right to read/write the resource. By default, entity classes are set to `django.contrib.auth.User`. We also provide a permission class, which by default ensures that only active entities `users` have permission to read/write the resource.

```python
class IsActiveEntity(BasePermission):
    """
    A base permission that only checks if the entity (by default, the Django user) is
    active or not.
    """

    message = "Entity is not active."

    def has_permission(self, request: HttpRequest, view: typing.Any) -> bool:

        return request.user.is_active

    def has_object_permission(
        self, request: HttpRequest, view: typing.Any, obj
    ) -> bool:

        return request.user.is_active
```

You can then call use this class in your view 👇

```python
from drf_simple_apikey.permissions import IsActiveEntity

class YourViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
    ...
    authentication_classes = (APIKeyAuthentication, )
    permission_classes = (IsActiveEntity, )
```
