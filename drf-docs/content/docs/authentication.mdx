description: Using the APIKeyAuthentication backend for API key authentication
---

Authentication is used here to identify an entity and make it easy to verify authorization and permissions on each request. By default, we provide an authentication backend that checks for the API Key format and ensures that an entity with this API key exists. Django REST Framework comes with authentication backends that set the `request.user`. With the `APIKeyAuthentication` class, you can find the entity of the Api Key at `request.user` too.

> Working with `request.user` which might not necessarily be an `User` might be a little bit counter-intuitive, but we are looking for solutions to have something such as `request.entity` without having to disrupt the Django REST Framework authentication and authorization flow. If you have some ideas, feel free to open an issue https://github.com/koladev32/drf-simple-apikey/issues.

## Use the `APIKeyAuthentication` backend

In your view, you can add the `APIKeyAuthentication` class to the `authentication_classes` attribute.

```python
class YourViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
    http_method_names = ["get"]
    authentication_classes = (APIKeyAuthentication, )
...
```

By default, we check the `authorization` header for a value with a similar format 👉 `Api-Key API_KEY_VALUE`.

The `Api-Key` is by default `AUTHENTICATION_KEYWORD_HEADER` which you can modify in the `settings.py` file of your Django project.

```python
DRF_API_KEY = {
    ...
    "AUTHENTICATION_KEYWORD_HEADER": "YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUE",
}
```

## Security Features

The authentication backend includes several security features to protect your API:

- **Timing attack protection**: We use constant-time comparisons to prevent attackers from learning about valid API keys by measuring response times.

- **HTTPS enforcement**: By default, we reject API key authentication over unencrypted HTTP connections in production.

- **IP address validation**: When using IP whitelisting or blacklisting, we safely extract and validate IP addresses, even when behind proxies.

For more details about these security features and how they work, see the [Security](/docs/security) documentation.
