title: Customizing API Key Model
description: How to create a custom API key model for your entity
---

You can customize the Api Key model to suit your needs if, for example, you have an entity different than the default one used. Here's an example using a custom class called `Organization`.

```python
# organizations/models.py
from django.db import models
from drf_simple_apikey.models import AbstractAPIKey

class Organization(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class OrganizationAPIKey(AbstractAPIKey):
    entity = models.ForeignKey(
        Organization,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="api_keys",
    )
```

After that, run the `makemigrations` command to generate to tell Django to generate a new table for the custom model.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

And then run the migrations.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
