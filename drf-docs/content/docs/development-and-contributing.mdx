description: Guidelines for contributing to the project
---

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Version Management

We use [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to manage version numbers across the project. This ensures that version numbers are updated consistently in all the right places.

**Installing bump2version:**

```bash
pip install bump2version
```

**How it works:**

The project uses a `setup.cfg` file to configure bump2version. It automatically updates version numbers in:

- `setup.cfg` (current_version)
- `pyproject.toml` (version field)
- `drf_simple_apikey/version.py` (VERSION constant)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (adds new version entry with date)

**Bumping versions:**

To bump the version, use one of these commands:

```bash
# Bump patch version (2.2.1 → 2.2.2)
bump2version patch

# Bump minor version (2.2.1 → 2.3.0)
bump2version minor

# Bump major version (2.2.1 → 3.0.0)
bump2version major
```

**What happens:**

1. Bump2version updates all version numbers in the configured files
2. It automatically creates a commit with the version bump
3. It creates a git tag for the new version
4. It updates the CHANGELOG.md with a new version entry

**Important notes:**

- Always update the CHANGELOG.md with the changes before bumping the version
- The CHANGELOG entry for the new version will be created automatically, but you need to add the actual changes under it
- After bumping, push both the commit and the tag: `git push && git push --tags`
